# Overview
The Chat Portal with FTP enabled is a web-based application that allows users to chat with each other in real-time while also providing file transfer functionality through the FTP protocol.
The chat portal enables users to create accounts and login to the application. Once logged in, users can join public chat rooms and create their own chat rooms. The application is built using modern web technologies such as React, Node.js, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and Filezilla Server as our FTP Server.
In addition to chat functionality, the application also allows users to upload, download, and manage files through the FTP protocol. This enables users to easily share files with other users in the chat rooms. The application has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate and interact with the chat and FTP features.

# Future Work
While we have successfully built a basic chat application, there is still room for improvement. One of the features that we could add is direct messaging, which allows users to talk one-on-one with each other. This could be done by implementing a new route and Socket.IO event that handles direct messaging.
Another potential future improvement is to implement better security measures to protect user data, such as encrypting messages and implementing stricter authorization checks. Overall, there are many potential directions for future work, and we hope that this project has provided a solid foundation for building more advanced chat applications in the future.
